# CLAUDE.md — Todoist Points

Guidance for Claude Code / agents working in this repo.

## What this is

A personal gamification layer for Todoist: earn points for completed tasks (valued by **label**), spend them on rewards. Local-first, single-user (Graham). Pilot project for a PM-style autonomous coding workflow — Graham describes features in plain English, agents implement, Graham reviews the **running app** (behavior, not diffs) and merges.

## Stack

- Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- SQLite via `better-sqlite3` (local file, gitignored)
- Todoist unified API v1 (`https://api.todoist.com/api/v1`), auth via `TODOIST_API_TOKEN` env var

## Earning model (important)

Points are assigned **per Todoist label**, NOT by priority. The app reads the user's labels and lets him assign a point value to each. A completed task awards points based on its label(s). Open design choices to confirm with Graham as they come up: multi-label task = sum vs. max of label values; no-label task = 0 or a default.

## Run / test

> Keep this section updated as the project gains commands.
- Install: `npm install`
- Dev server: `npm run dev` → http://localhost:3000
- Build: `npm run build`
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Git workflow (matches Graham's global rules)

- **Feature / non-protected branches:** commit and push freely.
- **`main` is protected:** never push or merge to it directly. Changes land on `main` ONLY via a PR that Graham reviews and merges himself after looking at the running app.
- Note: agents run with Graham's GitHub credentials, so the "only Graham merges" guarantee is workflow-enforced, not a hard technical lock — respect it.

## Secret & data safety (this repo is PUBLIC)

- NEVER commit `.env` or the SQLite database — both are gitignored. Use `.env.example` (placeholders only) for documentation.
- Never hardcode the Todoist token or real personal task/label data into committed source.
- The real token comes from the environment at runtime.

## Self-maintenance

When you add or change a capability, integration, dependency, command, or architectural decision here, update THIS file before considering the task done. This is how context persists for the next agent/session.
