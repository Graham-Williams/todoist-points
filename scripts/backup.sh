# backup.sh — Automated off-box backups for the self-hosted Todoist Points deployment.
#
# SCOPE: This script is specific to the self-hosted home-server deployment (the
# same Ubuntu box that runs km-tracker, running Todoist Points via Docker
# Compose). It runs on the HOST — not inside the app container — and snapshots
# the live SQLite DB that is bind-mounted into the container, then pushes
# snapshots off-box to Google Drive via rclone on a throttled cadence. It is
# driven by a systemd timer (see deploy/todoist-points-backup.timer). It is NOT
# used in local dev or CI.
#
# The points ledger is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for this app (it is not re-derivable
# from Todoist — spends/rewards/manual-review decisions live only here), so an
# off-box copy matters.
#
# Design (mirrors km-tracker's scripts/backup.sh):
#   - Frequent, cheap LOCAL snapshots (every timer tick) using SQLite's online
#     backup API, deduplicated by sha256 so identical DBs don't pile up.
#   - Decoupled, throttled DRIVE pushes (default every ~15 min, and only when the
#     DB actually changed) so we don't hammer the Drive API.
#   - The local-snapshot half always runs even if the Drive half can't (e.g.
#     rclone not configured) — losing the off-box copy must never cost us the
#     on-box copy. If rclone isn't set up yet we exit 0 (local copy is safe); we
#     only exit non-zero when a configured remote actually errors.
#   - A long-tail DRIVE "daily/" tier keeps at most one snapshot per UTC day for
#     DAILY_RETENTION days, defending against slow logical corruption that would
#     otherwise rotate out of the flat recent-snapshot ring buffer.
#
# Secrets: the rclone OAuth token lives ONLY in rclone's own config
# (~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf). No tokens or secrets are read from, written to,
# or echoed by this script.
